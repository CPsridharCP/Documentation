Let's get started!

**Please read these brief onboarding articles thoroughly prior to meeting Misty.**

You now have (or soon will) a hand-built Misty I robot from the Misty Robotics team. You’ll be able to program Misty to do a range of activities, such as drive from one room to the next, issue sounds to speakers, capture images from the camera, and so on. More abilities will become available as they are developed by the Misty engineering team and by you, the Misty community. 

Ask questions. 

Share knowledge.

## SAFETY WARNING

Misty uses a laser sensor to see the world. It is located above her right eye. 

**Never look directly into the laser!**

**Do not directly touch this sensor or remove the protective cover over this sensor!**

**Oils on your finger can cause the laser to disperse into your eyes and CAUSE SEVERE PHYSICAL DAMAGE!**

## Handling Misty

While future versions of Misty will be much tougher, it’s important that you handle Misty I Developer Edition with care. When carrying Misty, support the entire robot from the front and back, below the main chassis between the two tracks.

**Note: If you are powering up Misty on a table top, it’s a good idea to use the small cardboard box that came in Misty’s packaging as a stand.** Simply place the box under Misty, between her tracks. When Misty’s movement is activated, Misty’s tracks will move freely, but she will stay safely in place.
