## Turning Misty On

1. Use the small cardboard box (that came in her packaging) as a stand for Misty. Place the box under Misty, between her tracks.
2. Plug the power adaptor into the back of Misty and into a power source.![power adaptor plug](../../../assets/images/power_adaptor_plug.jpg)
3. Flip the power switch on Misty’s back (located above and to the left of the power adaptor). ![power switch](../../../assets/images/power_switch.jpg)
4. The light on Misty’s chest should come on, as should a blue LED connector light on the front-right side of Misty's head. ![blue light](../../../assets/images/blue_light.jpg)
5. You’ll know Misty is booted up when you see her eyes. This should take a little more than a minute.

## Restarting Misty

1. If you need to restart Misty, turn off the power switch on Misty’s back.
2. Wait 10 seconds.
3. Turn on the power switch on Misty's back again.
4. Once you see the blue LED light up again and Misty's eyes re-appear, you're ready.

## Turning Misty Off

Just turn off the power switch on Misty’s back.

**Note: There is no graceful shutdown at this time. When Misty’s battery gets below about 7 volts she abruptly powers down.**

**Note: At this time, updates of Misty's underlying operating system platforms (e.g. Windows IoT Core) may occur without warning. If you see an image of gears on Misty's screen, be aware that she is going through a system update.**
