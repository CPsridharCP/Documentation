## When Misty Arrives: Plugging in the Battery

1. Set Misty on the floor or use the small cardboard box (that came in her packaging) as a stand for Misty. Place the box under Misty, between her tracks.
2. Undo the two screws that attach the plastic plate to the front of Misty's chest. Remove the plate and set it and the screws aside. ![removing the chest plate](../../../assets/images/1_remove_chestplate.jpg)
3. Gently lift upward the plastic "wing" on Misty's right side. Remove it and set it aside. ![removing the wing](../../../assets/images/2_remove_wing.jpg)
4. You will see Misty's battery and two sets of connecting plugs. ![disconnected battery plugs](../../../assets/images/3_arrival_state.jpg)
5. Plug the yellow connectors together. ![yellow battery connectors](../../../assets/images/4_yellow_connectors.jpg)
6. Plug the white connectors together. ![white battery connectors](../../../assets/images/5_white_connectors.jpg)
7. Gently make sure the battery and connectors are inserted into Misty. ![reinserting the battery](../../../assets/images/6_push_battery.jpg)
8. Replace the right plastic wing and reattach Misty's chest plate.
9. Plug the power adaptor into the back of Misty and into a power source. ![power adaptor plug](../../../assets/images/power_adaptor_plug.jpg)


## Turning Misty On

1. Flip the power switch on Misty’s back (located above and to the left of the power adaptor). ![power switch](../../../assets/images/power_switch.jpg)
2. The light on Misty’s chest should come on, as should a blue LED connector light on the front-right side of Misty's head. ![blue light](../../../assets/images/blue_light.jpg)
3. Misty's eyes should appear on screen, beginning in a closed state. The eyes gradually open more fully. ![closed eyes](../../../assets/images/blink.jpg)
4. When the eyes appear fully open, Misty is done booting up. This should take a little more than a minute. **Note: If after a few minutes, Misty's eyes still do not appear fully open, contact technical support for assistance.**  ![fully open eyes](../../../assets/images/open.jpg)


## Restarting Misty

1. If you need to restart Misty, turn off the power switch on Misty’s back.
2. Wait 10 seconds.
3. Turn on the power switch on Misty's back again.
4. Once you see the blue LED light and Misty's eyes fully re-open, you're ready.

## Turning Misty Off

Just turn off the power switch on Misty’s back.

**Note: There is no graceful shutdown at this time. When Misty’s battery gets below about 7 volts she abruptly powers down.**

**Note: At this time, critical updates of Misty's underlying operating system platforms (e.g. Windows IoT Core) may occur without warning. If you see an image of gears on Misty's screen, be aware that she is going through a system update.**
