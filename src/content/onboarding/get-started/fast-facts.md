* Has a 4K camera for face and object recognition.
* Can listen with a 3x far-field microphone array.
* Moves her head via a servo for pitch (up and down) articulation.
* Includes a 4.3" LCD screen on the front of her head.
* Uses an Occipital Structure Core depth sensor to navigate.
* Has 2 Qualcomm Snapdragon processors: one running Windows 10 IoT Core and one running Android 7.
* Uses real-time and motor controllers.
* Senses with 4 time-of-flight sensors (3 front, 1 rear).
* Gets flashy with a multicolor LED behind her name plate in front
