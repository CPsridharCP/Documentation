Welcome! Your Misty I robot has been hand-built by the Misty Robotics team. Please start here for some quick words of advice on handling Misty. 


## Laser Safety

Misty uses a laser sensor located above her right eye to see the world.

**IMPORTANT! Never look directly into the laser!**

**Do not directly touch this sensor or remove the protective cover over this sensor. Oils on your finger can cause the laser to disperse into your eyes and CAUSE SEVERE PHYSICAL DAMAGE!**

## Fire Safety

**IMPORTANT! For your safety, please note the following:**

1. **Always** use the power supply (12-volt, 3 Amp, **center positive**) that came with Misty. Using a differently configured power supply creates a **high risk of fire**.

2. If you encounter any resistance or difficulty plugging the power supply into the jack on the back of Misty: STOP. Pull the plug out and try again, rotating the plug if necessary, until the plug inserts smoothly. It’s possible to catch the ground leaf spring on the bottom of the jack with the power supply plug and create a short. This renders Misty inoperative.

3. **Never** unplug the power connectors inside Misty. These connectors can be reversed or otherwise improperly re-inserted and create a **high risk of fire**.

## Handling Misty

While future versions of Misty will be much tougher, it’s important that you handle your Misty I Developer Edition robot with care. When carrying Misty, support the entire robot from the front and back, below the main chassis between the two tracks.

**Note: If you are powering up Misty on a table top, it’s a good idea to use the small cardboard box that came in Misty’s packaging as a stand.** Simply place the box under Misty, between her tracks. When Misty’s movement is activated, Misty’s tracks will move freely, but she will stay safely in place.
