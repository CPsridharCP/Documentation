Misty seeming a little tired lately? It may be time to perform an over-the-air (OTA) update. Updates can include:

* Image assets
* Sound assets
* Motor controller firmware
* Real-time controller firmware 
* Occipital Structure Core depth sensor firmware
* Home Robot application (running on Windows IoT Core)
* Sensory Services application (running on Android)

**Note: Currently, for ease of use on different platforms, we recommend performing updates manually, following the steps below. If you have issues with the manual update process, you can try the instructions for updating Misty using [the API Explorer](../../3-ways-to-interact-with-misty/api-explorer/#system-updates).**
