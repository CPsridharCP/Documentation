Misty checks for available system updates every time you turn her on or restart her. If you've not restarted her recently, you can check for and perform updates for Misty with the [Misty Companion app](../../3-ways-to-interact-with-misty/companion-app/#updating-misty) or [API Explorer](../../3-ways-to-interact-with-misty/api-explorer/#system-updates).

Updates can include:

* Image and/or sound assets
* Motor controller firmware
* Real-time controller firmware 
* Occipital Structure Core depth sensor firmware
* Home Robot application (running on Windows IoT Core)
* Sensory Services application (running on Android)
* OS updates

We recommend you check for updates on a weekly basis.
