## Support

When you are accepted into the Misty Developer Program, you will receive an invitation to the [Misty Community Slack channel.](http://misty-community.slack.com) This channel serves as the first line response for all issues and questions you may have with your robot.

The support channel is monitored for immediate response (5-10 minutes) from 7:00am-10:00pm MST on weekdays and from 7:00am-7:00pm MST on weekends.

If you are in the Developer program and have not received an invitation to Misty Builders, please write us at: community @ mistyrobotics.com.

## Forums

Our [Misty Forums](http://forums.mistyrobotics.com/) include FAQs and technical discussion about Misty, as well as spirited conversation on all things Robot.

Join our top engineers and thought leaders in discussion about features you want to see in the Misty and where the rapidly-evolving industry is (or should be!) headed.
