# {{title}}

The following are Misty's available WebSocket data stream types. You can filter all WebSocket options so (a) they return only a specified subset of the data and (b) check current values before the data is sent.

**Note**: All of Misty's WebSocket data structures are subject to change.

## TimeOfFlight

Misty has four time-of-flight sensors that provide raw proximity data (in meters) in a single stream. The ```TimeOfFlight``` WebSocket sends this data any time a time-of-flight sensor is triggered. It is possible for proximity data to be sent as frequently as every 70 milliseconds, though it can be significantly slower. It is not sent at timed intervals.

Sample time-of-flight sensor data:
```javascript
TimeOfFlight{
	"EventName":"TimeOfFlight",
	"Message":{
		"Created":"2018-03-30T20:36:46.5816862Z",
		"DistanceInMeters":0.184,
		"Expiry":"2018-03-30T20:36:46.9316897Z",
		"SensorId":"CD727A0A",
		"SensorPosition":"Right"
	},
	"Type":"TimeOfFlight"
}
```

## ComputerVision (Beta)

You can subscribe to the ```ComputerVision``` WebSocket to obtain data on both face detection and face recognition events.

The ```EventName``` value is the name you provide when you register the WebSocket connection.  

If face recognition is running on the robot, and a previously trained face is recognized, the ```PersonName``` value is the name previously assigned to that face. The ```PersonName``` value is ```unknown_person``` if an untrained/unknown face is detected. The ```PersonName``` value is ```null``` if face recognition is not currently running.

```TrackId``` is reserved data that may change in the future.

Sample ComputerVision data for a face recognition event:
```javascript
ComputerVision{
	"EventName":"MyFaceRecognition",
	"Message":{
		"Bearing":-3,
		"Created":"2018-07-02T16:26:20.1718422Z",
		"Distance":71,
		"Elevation":3,
		"Expiry":"2018-07-02T16:26:20.9218446Z",
		"PersonName":"Barkley",
		"SensorId":null,
		"SensorName":null,
		"TrackId":0
	},
	"Type":"ComputerVision"
}
```

## FaceDetection (Deprecated)

**Note**: The ```FaceDetection``` WebSocket is deprecated. Use the ```ComputerVision``` WebSocket instead.

The ```FaceDetection``` WebSocket returns only raw face detection data. Currently, this sensory data is not aggregated with other face data, so there may be empty and ```null``` fields.

The ```FaceDetection``` WebSocket data is sent only upon a sensory message trigger. It is not sent at timed intervals. The approximate transmission rate of ```FaceDetection``` data is 4x/second, but this timing can vary.

Sample face detection data:
```javascript
FaceDetection{
	"EventName":"FaceDetection",
	"Message":{
		"Bearing":-3,
		"Created":"2018-04-02T16:25:00.6934206Z",
		"Distance":71,
		"Elevation":3,
		"Expiry":"2018-04-02T16:25:01.4434254Z",
		"FaceId":3,
		"PersonName":null,
		"SensorId":null
	},
	"Type":"FaceDetection"
}
```

## FaceRecognition (Deprecated)

**Note**: The ```FaceRecognition``` WebSocket is deprecated. Use the ```ComputerVision``` WebSocket instead.

The ```FaceRecognition``` WebSocket returns only raw face recognition data. Currently, this sensory data is not aggregated with other face data, so there may be empty and ```null``` fields, including the recognized name.

The ```FaceRecognition``` WebSocket data is sent only upon a sensory message trigger. It is not sent at timed intervals. The approximate transmission rate of ```FaceRecognition``` data is 1x/second, but this timing can vary.

Sample face recognition data:
```javascript
FaceRecognition{
	"EventName":"FaceRecognition",
	"Message":{
		"Bearing":0,
		"Created":"2018-04-02T16:26:20.1718422Z",
		"Distance":0,
		"Elevation":0,
		"Expiry":"2018-04-02T16:26:20.9218446Z",
		"FaceId":12,
		"PersonName":"Barkley",
		"SensorId":null
	},
	"Type":"FaceRecognition"
}
```

## LocomotionCommand

```LocomotionCommand``` WebSocket data is sent every time the linear or angular velocity of the robot changes. It is not sent at timed intervals.

Sample locomotion data:
```javascript
LocomotionCommand{
	"EventName":"LocomotionCommand",
	"Message":{
		"ActionId":0,
		"AngularVelocity":0,
		"Created":"2018-04-02T22:59:39.3350238Z",
		"LinearVelocity":0.30000000000000004,
		"UsePid":true,
		"UseTrapezoidalDrive":true,
		"ValueIndex":0
	},
	"Type":"LocomotionCommand"
}
```

## HaltCommand

```HaltCommand``` WebSocket data is sent every time the robot stops and contains the date and time of the event. It is not sent at timed intervals.

## SelfState

The ```SelfState``` WebSocket provides a variety of data about Misty’s current internal state, including:

* battery charge, voltage, and charging status
* IP address
* affect
* position and orientation ("pose")
* SLAM status
* sensor messages

**Note:** There are a number of fields in the WebSocket data structure that are reserved for future use and which may be empty or contain ```null``` data:
* ```Acceleration```
* ```BumpedState```
* ```CurrentGoal```
* ```MentalState```
* ```Personality```
* ```PhysiologicalBehavior```

```SelfState``` WebSocket messages are sent even if the data has not changed, as the data is sent via timed updates, instead of being triggered by events. The ```SelfState``` WebSocket can send data as frequently as every 100ms, though it is set by default to 250ms. To avoid having to handle excess data, you can change the message frequency for the WebSocket with the ```DebounceMs``` field, as shown in the ```lightSocket.js``` JavaScript helper.

Sample SelfState data:
```javascript
SelfState {
    "eventName": "SelfState",
    "message": {
        "acceleration": null,
        "batteryChargePercent": 0,
        "batteryVoltage": 0,

## WorldState

The ```WorldState``` WebSocket sends data about the environment Misty is perceiving, including:
* the locations of perceived objects
* the times they were perceived

```WorldState``` WebSocket messages are sent even if the data has not changed, as the data is sent via timed updates, instead of being triggered by events. The ```WorldState``` WebSocket can send data as frequently as every 100ms, though it is set by default to 250ms. To avoid having to handle excess data, you can change the message frequency for the WebSocket with the ```DebounceMs``` field, as shown in the ```lightSocket.js``` JavaScript helper.
