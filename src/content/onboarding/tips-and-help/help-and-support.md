## Support

When you are accepted into the Misty Developer Program, you will receive an invitation to the [Misty Community Slack channel.](http://misty-community.slack.com) This channel serves as the first line response for all issues and questions you may have with your robot.

The support channel is monitored for immediate response (5-10 minutes) from 7:00am-10:00pm MST on weekdays and from 7:00am-7:00pm MST on weekends.

If you are in the Developer program and have not received an invitation to Misty Builders, please write us at: **community @ mistyrobotics.com**.

## Forums

Our [Misty Forums](http://forums.mistyrobotics.com/) include FAQs and technical discussion about Misty, as well as spirited conversation on all things Robot.
