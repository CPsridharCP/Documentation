1. For best control, we recommend that mapping be done at this time via the API Explorer and Blockly instead of with the companion app.
2. Verify that the mapping sensors are working. The Occipital laser near Misty’s right eye should be glowing blue.
3. Drive Misty around to see if a map generates.
4. Drive slowly to give the tracking system the best chance to fill in all details. Adjusting the speed with the slider on the companion app towards the left will slow Misty down and increase mapping effectiveness.
5. Make wider turns (in arcs) to improve mapping results.
6. If tracking is lost, try backing up for one second. Misty may find her way again and renew her mapping activities.
7. If Misty loses her connection while mapping (indicated when the two dots disappear from the companion app’s Bluetooth icon), close the app and restart it, then reconnect as before.
8. If Misty loses pose after generating a map, she will need to generate a new map and start over.
