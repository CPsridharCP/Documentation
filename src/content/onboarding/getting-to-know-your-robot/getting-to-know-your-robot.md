# {{title}}

Your Misty I Developer Edition robot has been lovingly hand-built by the Misty team. 

Some quick facts. She...
* Stands about 14” tall.
* Has a torso and head made of black plastic.
* Utilizes a track-based, differential drive system.
* Moves her head via a servo for pitch articulation.
* Includes a screen on the front of her head.
* Uses a structured light sensor from Occipital to navigate.
* Tolerates a “periscope-style” webcam mounted on her head (Misty 1 Beta version only).
* Carries an Intrinsyc 820 dev kit board at her side (Misty 1 Beta version only).
* Includes a Dragonboard 410-C development board.
* Uses real-time and motor controllers.
* Senses with 4 time-of-flight sensors (3 in front, 1 in rear).
* Gets flashy with a multicolor LED behind her name plate in front
* Is powered via a barrel connector charger jack in the back, as well as a 2200 milliamp hour lithium polymer battery (power adapter included).
* Has a serial expansion port for, you know, serial devices. 
* Ships with a small cardboard box that can be used as a stand. This prevents Misty from getting away and rolling off the table while you are working with her.
