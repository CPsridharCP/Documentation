## Programming Misty with Blockly

1. Make sure Misty and your computer are on the same Wi-Fi network and that your computer’s Bluetooth is on.
2. Open Blockly [in your web browser.](https://misty:MistyRocks!@blockly.mistyrobotics.io/)
3. Enter the IP address of your robot from the Info tab in the companion app, and hit Return. The connection status field should become green. **Note: If the status field stays red, double-check that Misty and your computer are on the same network. If necessary, reload the page.**
4. Select some programming Logic or Loops to use, then try adding in some blocks from the MISTY category on the left.
5. Move blocks around. :) 
6. Click Run and see how Misty reacts...
