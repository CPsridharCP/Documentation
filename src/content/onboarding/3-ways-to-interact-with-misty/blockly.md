Blockly is a block-based, visual programming language editor that runs in your browser. We recommend the following browsers for running Blockly with Misty: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge (latest versions).

## Starting to Program Misty with Blockly 

1. Make sure Misty and your computer are on the same Wi-Fi network and that your computer has Bluetooth turned on.
2. [Download Blockly.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/docs.mistyrobotics.io/assets/files/Blockly.zip) Unzip the Blockly download and open the index.html file in your browser.
3. Enter the IP address of your robot from the Info tab in the companion app, and hit Return. The connection status field should become green. **Note: If the status field stays red, double-check that Misty and your computer are on the same network. If necessary, reload the page.**
4. Select some programming Logic or Loops to use, then try adding in some blocks from the MISTY category on the left.
5. Move blocks around. :) 
6. Click Run and see how Misty reacts. **Note: After clicking Run, there currently can be a 2-3 second delay before Misty reacts, and up to a 5-second delay between actions.**
7. For detailed information on Misty's Blockly commands, see the descriptions in [Blockly API](../../../../../apis/api-reference/blockly).
