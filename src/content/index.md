There are two basic types of skill architecture for Misty:
* **Remote:** Your code runs on an external device (say, in desktop browser or on a Raspberry Pi) and not onboard the robot. 
* **Local:** You upload your code to the robot, and it runs internally on Misty. Local skills can interact with external data (cloud calls, non-Misty API calls, etc).
