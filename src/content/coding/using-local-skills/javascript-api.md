Use the JavaScript API to write skills for Misty that run locally on your robot. For more about local skills, see [Local Skill Architecture](../architecture).

**Note:** Not all of Misty's API is equally complete. You may see some commands labeled "Beta" or "Alpha" because the related hardware, firmware, or software is still under development. Feel free to use these commands, but realize they may behave unpredictably at this time.

## Images & Display

<!-- Images & Display - PRODUCTION -->

### misty.ChangeDisplayImage
Displays an image on Misty's screen. Optionally, `misty.ChangeDisplayImage()` can display an image for a specific length of time and/or transparently overlay an image on Misty's eyes. You can use the [`SaveImageAssetToRobot`](../../using-remote-commands/rest/#saveimageassettorobot-byte-array-string-) command in Misty's REST API to upload images to Misty.

Note that it's not possible for a custom image to overlay another custom image. Misty's eyes always appear as the base image, behind an overlay.

```JavaScript
// Syntax
misty.ChangeDisplayImage(string fileName, [double timeoutInSeconds], [double alpha], [int prePause], [int postPause])
```

Arguments

* fileName (string) - Name of the file containing the image to display. Valid image file types are .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .png. Maximum file size is 3MB. To clear the image from the screen, pass an empty string ```""```.
* timeoutInSeconds (double) - Optional. The length of time to display the specified image. 
* alpha (double) - Optional. The transparency of the image. A value of 0 is completely transparent; 1 is completely opaque. When you specify a value greater than 0 and less than 1, the image appears but is transparent, and Misty's eyes appear behind the specified image. Defaults to 1.
* prePause (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait before executing this command.
* postPause (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait between executing this command and executing the next command in the skill. If no command follows this command, `postPause` is not used.

```JavaScript
// Example
misty.ChangeDisplayImage("Happy.png", 10, 0.5, 0, 0);
```

<!-- misty.DeleteImageAssetFromRobot -->

### misty.DeleteImageAssetFromRobot
Enables you to remove an image file from Misty that you have previously saved to her storage.

**Note:** You can only delete image files that you have previously saved to Misty's storage. You cannot remove Misty's default system image files.

```JavaScript
// Syntax
misty.DeleteImageAssetFromRobot(string filename, [int prePause], [int postPause]);
```

Arguments

* fileName (string) - The name of the file to delete, including its file type extension.
* prePause (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait before executing this command.
* postPause (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait between executing this command and executing the next command in the skill. If no command follows this command, `postPause` is not used.

```JavaScript
// Example
misty.DeleteImageAssetFromRobot("DeleteMe.png");
```

<!-- misty.GetListOfImages -->
### misty.GetListOfImages
Obtains a list of the images stored on Misty.

**Note:** With local skills, data returned by this and other "Get" type commands must be passed into a callback function to be processed and made available for use in your skill. By default, callback functions for "Get" type commands are given the same name as the correlated command, prefixed with an underscore: `_<COMMAND>`. For more on handling data returned by "Get" type commands, see ["Get" Data Callbacks](../architecture/#-get-data-callbacks).

```JavaScript
// Syntax
misty.GetListOfImages([string callbackMethod], [string callbackRule = "synchronous"], [string skillToCallUniqueId], [int prePause], [int postPause])
```

Arguments

* callbackMethod (string) - Optional. The name of the callback function to call when the data returned by this command is ready. If empty, the default callback function (`<_CommandName>`) is called. 
* callbackRule (string) - Optional. The callback rule for this command. Available callback rules are `"synchronous"`, `"override"`, and `"abort"`. Defaults to `"synchronous"`.
* skillToCallUniqueId (string) - Optional. The unique id of a skill to trigger for the callback, instead of calling back into the same skill.
* prePause (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait before executing this command.
* postPause (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait between executing this command and executing the next command in the skill. If no command follows this command, `postPause` is not used.

// Example
misty.GetListOfImages();

function _GetListOfImages(data) {
    _imageList = JSON.stringify(data);
    misty.Debug(_imageList)
}
```

Returns

* Result (array) - Returns an array containing one element for each image currently stored on Misty. In a local skill, data returned by this command must be passed into a callback function to be processed and made available for use in your skill. See ["Get" Data Callbacks](../architecture/#-get-data-callbacks) for more information. Each element in the array contains the following:
   * Height (integer) - The height of the image file.
   * Name (string) - The name of the image file.
   * Width (integer) - The width of the image file.
   * UserAddedAsset (boolean) - If `true`, the file was added by the user. If `false`, the file is one of Misty's system files.

### misty.SaveImageAssetToRobot
Saves an image to Misty in the form of a byte array string. Optionally, proportionately reduces the size of the saved image.

Valid image file types are .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .png. Maximum file size is 3 MB. **Note:** Images can be reduced in size but not enlarged. Because Misty does not adjust the proportions of images, for best results use an image with proportions similar to her screen (480 x 272 pixels).

```JavaScript
// Syntax
misty.SaveImageAssetToRobot(string fileName, string dataAsByteArrayString, [int width], [int height], [bool immediatelyApply], [bool overwriteExisting], [int prePause], [int postPause]

* dataAsByteArrayString (string) - The image data, passed as a string containing a byte array.
* width (integer) - Optional. A whole number greater than 0 specifying the desired image width (in pixels). **Important:** To reduce the size of an image you must supply values for both `width` and `height`. Note that if you supply disproportionate values for `width` and `height`, the system uses the proportionately smaller of the two values to resize the image.
* height (integer) - Optional. A whole number greater than 0 specifying the desired image height (in pixels). **Important:** To reduce the size of an image you must supply values for both `width` and `height`. Note that if you supply disproportionate values for `width` and `height`, the system uses the proportionately smaller of the two values to resize the image.
* immediatelyApply (boolean) - Optional. A value of `true` tells Misty to immediately display the saved image file, while a value of `false` tells Misty not to display the image.
* overwriteExisting (boolean) - Optional. A value of `true` indicates the saved file should overwrite a file with the same name, if one currently exists on Misty. A value of `false` indicates the saved file should not overwrite any existing files on Misty.
* prePause (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait before executing this command.
* postPause (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait between executing this command and executing the next command in the skill. If no command follows this command, `postPause` is not used.

```

<!-- Images & Display - BETA -->

### misty.ClearDisplayText - BETA
Force-clears an error message from Mistyâ€™s display. **Note:** This command is provided as a convenience. You should not typically need to call `misty.ClearDisplayText()`.

// from misty.SlamGetDepthImage is ready
function _SlamGetDepthImage(data) {
    _depthImageData = JSON.stringify(data);
    misty.Debug(_depthImageData);
}

// Use misty.SlamStopStreaming() to close the
// data stream from the depth sensor after
// obtaining a depth image
misty.SlamStopStreaming(20000);
```

Returns

- Result (object) - An object containing depth information about the image matrix, with the following fields. In a local skill, data returned by this command must be passed into a callback function to be processed and made available for use in your skill. See ["Get" Data Callbacks](../architecture/#-get-data-callbacks) for more information.
  - height (integer) - The height of the matrix.
  - image (array) - A matrix of size `height` x `width` containing individual values of type float. Each value is the distance in millimeters from the sensor for each pixel in the captured image. For example, if you point the sensor at a flat wall 2 meters away, most of the values in the matrix should be around 2000. Note that as the robot moves further away from a scene being viewed, each pixel value will represent a larger surface area. Conversely, if it moves closer, each pixel value will represent a smaller area.
  - width (integer) - The width of the matrix.

<!-- misty.SlamGetVisibleImage - ALPHA -->
### misty.SlamGetVisibleImage - ALPHA
Takes a photo using Mistyâ€™s Occipital Structure Core depth sensor.

**Note:** Make sure to use `SlamStartStreaming` to open the data stream from Misty's depth sensor before using this command. Mapping or tracking does not need to be active to use this command.

**Note:** With local skills, data returned by this and other "Get" type commands must be passed into a callback function to be processed and made available for use in your skill. By default, callback functions for "Get" type commands are given the same name as the correlated command, prefixed with an underscore: `_<COMMAND>`. For more on handling data returned by "Get" type commands, see ["Get" Data Callbacks](../architecture/#-get-data-callbacks).

Arguments

## Locomotion

<!-- misty.Drive --> 
### misty.Drive
Drives Misty forward or backward at a specific speed until cancelled. Call `misty.Stop()` to cancel driving. 

When using the `misty.Drive()` command, it helps to understand how linear velocity (speed in a straight line) and angular velocity (speed and direction of rotation) work together:

* Linear velocity (-100) and angular velocity (0) = driving straight backward at full speed.
* Linear velocity (100) and angular velocity (0) = driving straight forward at full speed.
* Linear velocity (0) and angular velocity (-100) = rotating clockwise at full speed.
* Linear velocity (0) and angular velocity (100) = rotating counter-clockwise at full speed.
* Linear velocity (non-zero) and angular velocity (non-zero) = Misty drives in a curve.

Arguments
* linearVelocity (double) - A percent value that sets the speed for Misty when she drives in a straight line. Default value range is from -100 (full speed backward) to 100 (full speed forward).
* angularVelocity (double) - A percent value that sets the speed and direction of Misty's rotation. Default value range is from -100 (full speed rotation clockwise) to 100 (full speed rotation counter-clockwise). **Note:** For best results when using angular velocity, we encourage you to experiment with using small positive and negative values to observe the effect on Misty's movement.
* prePause (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait before executing this command.
* postPause (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait between executing this command and executing the next command in the skill. If no command follows this command, `postPause` is not used.

### misty.DriveTime
Drives Misty forward or backward at a set speed, with a given rotation, for a specified amount of time.

When using the `misty.DriveTime()` command, it helps to understand how linear velocity (speed in a straight line) and angular velocity (speed and direction of rotation) work together:

* Linear velocity (-100) and angular velocity (0) = driving straight backward at full speed.
* Linear velocity (100) and angular velocity (0) = driving straight forward at full speed.
* Linear velocity (0) and angular velocity (-100) = rotating clockwise at full speed.

## Mapping & Tracking

"SLAM" refers to simultaneous localization and mapping. This is a robot's ability to both create a map of the world and know where they are in it at the same time. Misty's SLAM capabilities and hardware are under development. For a step-by-step mapping exercise, see the instructions with the [API Explorer](../../../onboarding/apps/api-explorer/#mapping-amp-tracking-alpha).

**Note:** If you are mapping with a **Misty I** or **Misty II prototype**, please be aware of the following:
* The USB cable connecting the headboard to the Occipital Structure Core depth sensor is known to fail in some Misty prototypes. This can cause intermittent or non-working mapping and localization functionality.
* Misty prototypes can only create and store one map at a time, and a map must be created in a single mapping session.
* Mapping a large room with many obstacles can consume all of the memory resources on the processor used for mapping and crash the device.
* Some Misty I and some Misty II prototypes may generate inaccurate maps due to depth sensor calibration flaws.

<!-- Mapping & Tracking - ALPHA>

<!-- misty.FollowPath - ALPHA -->
### misty.FollowPath - ALPHA
Drives Misty on a path defined by coordinates you specify. Note that Misty must have a map and be actively tracking before starting to follow a path. Misty will not be able to successfully follow a path if unmapped obstacles are in her way.

**Important!** Make sure to call `misty.SlamStartTracking()` to start Misty tracking her location before using this command, and call `misty.SlamStopTracking()` to stop Misty tracking her location after using this command.

Arguments
* path - List of sets of Integers - A list containing 1 or more sets of integer pairs representing X and Y coordinates. You can obtain `path` values from a map that Misty has previously generated.  *Note:* X values specify directions forward and backward. Sideways directions are specified by Y values.
* prePause (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait before executing this command.
* postPause (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait between executing this command and executing the next command in the skill. If no command follows this command, `postPause` is not used.

```JavaScript
misty.FollowPath(string path, [int prePause], [int postPause]);
```
<!-- 
Returns
* Result (boolean) - Returns `true` if there are no errors related to this command. -->

<!-- misty.SlamGetMap - ALPHA -->
### misty.SlamGetMap - ALPHA

Obtains occupancy grid data for the most recent map Misty has generated. 

**Note:** With local skills, data returned by this and other "Get" type commands must be passed into a callback function to be processed and made available for use in your skill. By default, callback functions for "Get" type commands are given the same name as the correlated command, prefixed with an underscore: `_<COMMAND>`. For more on handling data returned by "Get" type commands, see ["Get" Data Callbacks](../architecture/#-get-data-callbacks).

**Note:** To obtain a valid response from `SlamGetRawMap`, Misty must first have successfully generated a map. 

Mistyâ€™s maps are squares that are constructed around her initial physical location when she starts mapping. When a map is complete, it is a square with Mistyâ€™s starting point at the center.

The occupancy grid for the map is represented by a two-dimensional matrix. Each element in the occupancy grid represents an individual cell of space. The value of each element (0, 1, 2, or 3) indicates the nature of the space in those cells (respectively: "unknown", "open", "occupied", or "covered").

Each cell corresponds to a pair of X,Y coordinates that you can use with the `misty.FollowPath()`, `misty.DriveToLocation()`, and `misty.SlamGetPath()` commands. The first cell in the first array of the occupancy grid is the origin point (0,0) for the map. The X coordinate of a given cell is the index of the array for the cell. The Y coordinate of a cell is the index of that cell within its array. 

Arguments
* callbackMethod (string) - Optional. The name of the callback function to call when the data returned by this command is ready. If empty, the default callback function (`<_CommandName>`) is called.
* callbackRule (string) - Optional. The callback rule for this command. Available callback rules are `"synchronous"`, `"override"`, and `"abort"`. Defaults to `"synchronous"`. For a description of callback rules, see ["Get" Data Callbacks](../architecture/#-get-data-callbacks).
* skillToCallUniqueId (string) - Optional. The unique id of a skill to trigger for the callback, instead of calling back into the same skill.
* prePause (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait before executing this command.
* postPause (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait between executing this command and executing the next command in the skill. If no command follows this command, `postPause` is not used.

```JavaScript
misty.SlamGetMap([string callbackMethod], [string callbackRule = "synchronous"], [string skillToCallUniqueId], [int prePause], [int postPause]);
```

Returns

* Result (object) - An object containing the following key-value pairs. In a local skill, data returned by this command must be passed into a callback function to be processed and made available for use in your skill. See ["Get" Data Callbacks](../architecture/#-get-data-callbacks) for more information.
  * grid (array of arrays) - The occupancy grid for the most recent map Misty has generated, represented by a matrix of cells. The number of arrays is equal to the value of the `height` parameter. The number of cells is equal to the product of `height` x `width`. Each individual value (0, 1, 2, or 3) in the matrix represents a single cell of space. 0 indicates "unknown" space, 1 indicates "open" space, 2 indicates "occupied" space, and 3 indicates "covered" space. Each cell corresponds to an X,Y coordinate on the occupancy grid. The first cell in the first array is the X,Y origin point (0,0) for the map. The X coordinate of a given cell is the index of the array for the cell. The Y coordinate of a cell is the index of that cell within its array. If no map is available, grid returns `null`.
  * height (integer) - The height of the occupancy grid matrix (in number of cells).
  * isValid (boolean) - Returns a value of `true` if the data returned represents a valid map. If no valid map data is available, returns a value of `false`.
  * metersPerCell (integer) - A value in square meters stating the size of each cell in the occupancy grid matrix.
  * originX (float) - The distance in meters from the X value of the occupancy grid origin (0,0) to the X coordinate of the physical location where Misty started mapping. The X,Y coordinates of Misty's starting point are always at the center of the occupancy grid. To convert this value to an X coordinate on the occupancy grid, use the formula 0 - (`originX` / `metersPerCell`). Round the result to the nearest whole number. 
  * originY (float) - The distance in meters from the Y value of the occupancy grid origin (0,0) to the Y coordinate of the physical location where Misty started mapping. The X,Y coordinates of Misty's starting point are always at the center of the occupancy grid. To convert this value to a Y coordinate on the occupancy grid, use the formula 0 - (`originY` / `metersPerCell`). Round the result to the nearest whole number. 
  * size (integer) - The total number of map cells represented in the grid array. Multiply this number by the value of meters per cell to calculate the area of the map in square meters.
  * width (integer) - The width of the occupancy grid matrix (in number of cells). 

<!-- misty.SlamGetPath - ALPHA -->

misty.RegisterTimerEvent(string eventName, int callbackTimeInMs, bool keepAlive, [string callbackRule], [string skillToCallUniqueID], [int prePause], [int postPause]);
```

Returns

* Data sent by the timed event. Event data must be passed into a callback function to be processed and made available for use in your skill. For more information, see [Timed or Triggered Event Callbacks](../architecture/#timed-or-triggered-event-callbacks).

<!-- misty.RegisterUserEvent -->
### misty.RegisterUserEvent - ALPHA
Creates an event that calls a callback function at a point of your choosing. You trigger the event by making a REST call to the `api/alpha/sdk/skills/event` endpoint with the appropriate payload for the callback and/or skill.

Once you register the event with `misty.RegisterUserEvent()`, to trigger the event you must make a REST call to the event endpoint with a POST command:

```http
POST {robot-ip-address}/api/alpha/sdk/skills/event
```

With a JSON body similar to:
```JSON
{
    "UniqueId" : "b307c917-beb8-47e8-9bbf-1c57e8cd4d4b",
    "EventName": "UserEventName",
    "Payload": { "mydata": "two" }
}
```

The `UniqueId` and `EventName` values are required and must match the ID of the skill to call and the event name you used in that skill. You should place any payload data you wish to send to the skill in the `Payload` field.

**Note:** Event data must be passed into a callback function to be processed and made available for use in your skill. By default, callback functions for this command are given the same name as the correlated event, prefixed with an underscore: `_<eventName>`. For more on handling event data, see [Timed or Triggered Event Callbacks](../architecture/#timed-or-triggered-event-callbacks).

Arguments
* eventName (string) - The name for the event. Note that the name you give to this event determines the name automatically assigned to your related callback function. That is, the system sets the name of the callback function to be the same as this event name, prefixed with an underscore (`_<eventName>`). For example, for an event name of `MyUserEvent`, your callback function must use the name `_MyUserEvent`. 
* keepAlive (bool) - Optional. By default (`false`) the event is triggered only once. If you pass `true`, you can trigger the event repeatedly. To remove this event, call the `UnregisterEvent` function in your code.
* callbackRule (string) - Optional. By default (`Synchronous`) the system runs the triggered callback concurrrently with any other running threads. Other values are `Override` and `Abort`. `Override` tells the system to run the new callback thread but to stop running commands on any other threads, including the thread the callback was called within. The system only runs the thread the callback was triggered in, once the callback comes back. `Abort` tells the system to ignore the new callback thread if the skill is still doing work on any other threads (including the original thread the callback was called within). 
* skillToCall (string) - Optional. The unique ID of a skill to call when the event is triggered. Use this value if the callback function is not defined in the same skill as the user event is registered in.
* prePause (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait before executing this command.
* postPause (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait between executing this command and executing the next command in the skill. If no command follows this command, `postPause` is not used.

```JavaScript
misty.RegisterUserEvent(string eventName, [bool keepAlive], [string callbackRule], [string skillToCall], [int prePause], [int postPause])
```

Returns

* Data sent by the user event. Event data must be passed into a callback function to be processed and made available for use in your skill. For more information, see [Timed or Triggered Event Callbacks](../architecture/#timed-or-triggered-event-callbacks).

### misty.UnregisterAllEvents - ALPHA

<!-- misty.Debug -->
### misty.Debug - ALPHA
Prints a message to the JavaScript console for the Skill Runner web page in your browser.

When you use Skill Runner to run a skill, the `SkillData` WebSocket connection is established at the time you connect to your robot. This enables printing debug messages to the JavaScript console. You can use `misty.Debug()` to send your own messages to the console. **Note:** If `BroadcastMode` is set to `off` in the meta file for a skill, no debug messages are sent.

```JavaScript
// Syntax
misty.Debug(string debugInfo, [int prePause], [int postPause]);
```

Arguments
* debugInfo (string) - The debug message to log to the console.
* prePause (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait before executing this command.
* postPause (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait between executing this command and executing the next command in the skill. If no command follows this command, `postPause` is not used.

```JavaScript
// Example

```

<!-- misty.Publish -->
### misty.Publish - ALPHA
Writes data to the robot's internal log.

Note that `misty.Publish()` writes data to the robot's internal log file, even when called in a skill with the value of `WriteToLog` set to `False` in its meta file. You can use the API Explorer to download your robot's log files, or send a GET request to the REST endpoint for the [`GetLogFile`](../../using-remote-commands/rest/#getlogfile) command. 

Arguments
* name (string) - A name for the data data to write to the robot's log.
* value (string, integer, double, or boolean) - The data to write to the robot's log. To write an object, you must serialize your data into a string using `JSON.stringify()`.

```JavaScript
misty.Publish(string name, string value)  
```

```

<!-- misty.Set --> 
### misty.Set - ALPHA
Saves data that can be validly updated and used across threads or shared between skills. 

**Important!** Data stored via the `misty.Set()` command **does not persist across a reboot** of the robot at this time.

Currently, any data saved to the robot this way is not automatically deleted and by default may be used across multiple skills. Data saved using `misty.Set()` must be one of these types: `string`, `bool`, `int`, or `double`. Alternately, you can serialize your data into a string using `JSON.stringify()` and parse it out again using `JSON.parse()`.

Arguments
* key (string) - The key name for the data to save.
* value (value ) - The data to save. Data saved using `misty.Set()` must be one of these types: `string`, `bool`, `int`, or `double`
* prePause (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait before executing this command.
* postPause (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait between executing this command and executing the next command in the skill. If no command follows this command, `postPause` is not used.

misty.Set(string key, string value, [int prePause], [int postPause]);
```

## External Server Communication

<!-- misty.SendExternalRequest --> 

### misty.SendExternalRequest - ALPHA
Sends an HTTP request from Misty to an external server. You use `misty.SendExternalRequest()` to access resources that are available via Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), such as cloud-based APIs or data stored on a server in another location.

**Note:** In most cases, the external server's response to requests sent from the robot must be passed into a callback function to be processed and made available for use in your skills. By default, the callback function for this command is given the same name as the command, prefixed with an underscore: `_<COMMAND>`. For more on handling data returned by `misty.SendExternalRequest()`, see the [External Requests](../tutorials/#external-requests) tutorial.

Arguments
* method (string) - The [HTTP request method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) (e.g. `GET`, `POST`, etc.) indicating the action to perform for the resource.
* resourceURL (string) - The full Uniform Resource Identifier of the resource, i.e. `"http://soundbible.com/grab.php?id=1949&type=mp3"`.
* authorization (string) - The authentication type required to access the resource, i.e. `"OAuth 1.0"`, `"OAuth 2.0"`, or `"Bearer Token"`. Use `null` if no authentication is required.
* token (string) - The authentication credentials required to access the resource. Use `null` if no credentials are required.
* arguments (string) - The arguments to send with the request, passed as a string written in JSON format with key-value pairs for each parameter option. If the request does not require additional arguments, pass `null` or an empty JSON string (`"{}"`).
* returnType (string) - The [Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) type indicating the nature and format of the expected response, i.e. `text/plain`.
* saveAssetToRobot (bool) - If `true`, the robot saves any media asset contained in the request response to the robot's local storage. If you do not want to save any returned assets, pass `false`. At this time, the `misty.SendExternalRequest()` command can save only image and audio files to Misty. 
* applyAssetAfterSaving (bool) - A value of `true` or `false` indicating whether to immediately use a media asset once it has been saved to Misty's local storage. Use `true` to immediately play an audio asset or display an image asset on Misty's screen. Note that to successfully apply a media asset, you must also pass `true` for the `saveAssetToRobot` parameter.
* fileNameWithExtension (string) - The name to give the saved file, including the appropriate file type extension.
* callbackMethod (string) - Optional. The name of the callback function to call when the returned data is received. If empty, a callback function with the default name (`_SendExternalRequest()`) is called.
* callbackRule (string) - Optional. The callback rule for this command. Available callback rules are `"synchronous"`, `"override"`, and `"abort"`. Defaults to `"synchronous"`. For a description of callback rules, see ["Get" Data Callbacks](../architecture/#-get-data-callbacks).
* skillToCallUniqueId (string) - Optional. The unique id of the skill to trigger for the callback function, if the callback is not defined in the current skill. 
* prePause (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait before executing this command.
* postPause (integer) - Optional. The length of time in milliseconds to wait between executing this command and executing the next command in the skill. If no command follows this command, `postPause` is not used.

```JavaScript
misty.SendExternalRequest(string method, string resourceURL, string authorizationType, string token, string returnType, string jsonArgs, bool saveAssetToRobot, bool applyAssetAfterSaving, string fileNameWithExtension, [string callbackMethod], [string callbackRule], [string skillToCallOnCallback], [int prePause], [int postPause]);
Returns
```

Returns

* Data (object) - An object containing the external server's response to the request. In most cases, data returned by the `misty.SendExternalRequest()` command must be passed into a callback function to be processed and made available for use in your skills. See the [External Requests](../tutorials/external-requests) tutorial for more information.
