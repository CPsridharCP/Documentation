 Blockly is a block-based, visual programming language developed by Google. Misty has a custom Blockly editor that runs in your web browser. We recommend the following browsers for running Blockly with Misty: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge (latest versions).

 To use Misty's API with Blockly, see [Blockly](../../../../../onboarding/3-ways-to-interact-with-misty/blockly).
