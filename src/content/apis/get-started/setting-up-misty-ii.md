Welcome! Your Misty II Field Trial robot has been designed and built by the Misty Robotics team. For safety during shipping, Misty II arrives with her battery disconnected. Start here for a quick guide to setting up your robot.

**Important!** Misty II features a built-in carrying handle on the back of her head. Grip this handle to carry your robot.

**Note:** To avoid the risk of driving Misty off a high surface, we recommend either working with your robot on the floor or temporarily elevating the treads so the robot cannot drive. To do this, you can place books or blocks between Misty's treads.

### What's in the Box?
Misty II arrives with her magnetic headpiece and “backpack” attached. In addition to Misty, your package arrives with the following items:
* charging pad
* power supply
* Misty II Getting Started guide

**Note:** Misty's packaging has been specially designed to protect your robot during shipping. Because you will need to return this Field Trial unit, please keep all original packaging for use in shipment.

### Connecting the Battery
You must connect Misty's battery before turning her on for the first time. Before you connect Misty's battery, please read the following important notes:
* Always use the battery that came with your Misty II.
* Always use a power supply (12-volt, 3 Amp, **center positive**) with the same specifications as that which came with Misty. Using a differently configured power supply creates a high risk of fire.
* If you encounter any resistance or difficulty plugging the power supply into the jack on the back of Misty: **STOP**. Pull the plug out and try again, rotating the plug if necessary, until the plug inserts smoothly. It’s possible to catch the ground leaf spring on the bottom of the jack with the power supply plug and create a short. This renders Misty inoperative.
* **Never** unplug the power connectors inside Misty. These connectors can be reversed or otherwise improperly re-inserted and create a **high risk of fire**.![Do not unplug these power connectors](../../../assets/images/mii-power-connecter-warning.jpg)

We ship Misty with her battery disconnected. Follow the steps below to access the battery compartment and connect Misty's battery:

1. Remove the bump sensor covers from Misty's base. Use the indentation at the edge of the bump sensor covers to pry each cover off of Misty's base. Misty II has two front-facing and two rear-facing bump sensor covers. All four bump sensor covers must be removed.
