Welcome to Misty's API! You can control Misty programmatically via [JavaScript](../../api-reference/all-functions) and [REST](../../api-reference/rest) endpoints in a variety of areas:

- **Action**
  - Drive Misty
  - Perform mapping or tracking
  - Play sound files
  - Change the LED color
  - Use face training and recognition
  - Move Misty's arms or head
  - Change Misty's display


- **Configuration**
  - Save audio or image files to Misty
  - Connect Misty to WiFi


- **Information**  
  - Get asset, sensor, device, and battery data
  - Obtain map data


You can also test commands with [Blockly](/onboarding/3-ways-to-interact-with-misty/blockly) and the [Misty API Explorer](/onboarding/3-ways-to-interact-with-misty/api-explorer).

**Note: Not all of Misty's API is equally complete. You may see some commands labeled "Beta" or "Alpha" because the related hardware, firmware, or software is still under development. Feel free to use these commands, but realize they may behave unpredictably at this time.**
