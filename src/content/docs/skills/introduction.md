Misty has two basic types of skill architecture: local and remote. 

When you write a [local skill](../../skills/local-skill-architecture), you upload your code to the robot, and it runs internally on Misty. This differs from [using remote commands](../../skills/remote-command-architecture) with Misty, where your code runs on an external device (say, in desktop browser or on a Raspberry Pi) and not onboard the robot.
