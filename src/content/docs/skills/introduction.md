Misty has two basic types of skill architecture. You can write skills using Misty's on-robot JavaScript API, or you can use her REST API.

When you write a skill using Misty's [on-robot JavaScript API](../../skills/local-skill-architecture), you upload your code to the robot and it runs internally on Misty. This differs from writing a skill with [Misty's REST API](../../skills/remote-command-architecture), where your code runs on an external device (say, in desktop browser or on a Raspberry Pi) and not onboard the robot.
